# MS-Teams-Integration

Use the AARI web interface from within MS Teams. Customize the manifest.json file with your own Automation 360 Control Room URL and upload the app to your org's app catalog to make it available to your team.

## Deploying the app to your organization

 1. Download or clone the project and edit the manifest.json file, replacing all instances of "your-a360-domain" with your own control room URL.
 2. Create a zip file containing the contents of the "Automation Anywhere" folder.
 3. In MS Teams, go to "Apps" and click on "Manage your apps" in the lower left corner.
 4. Click on "Upload an app".
 5. As a Teams admin, select "Upload an app to your org's app catalog".
 6. Alternatively, select "Submit an app to your org" to submit the app for review by your IT admin.
 7. Click "Add" on the next screen.
 8. When the App loads, you will be prompted to sign in to the Automation Anywhere control room. Click "Log in" to continue. The login window will close and the AARI interface will appear.

## End user installation

 1. In MS Teams, click the 3 dot menu in the left sidebar and search for the "Automation Anywhere" app.
 2. When prompted, log in to the Automation 360 control room and the AARI interface will appear.

Note: the Automation Anywhere app is currently not supported on mobile.
